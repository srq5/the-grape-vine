# The GrapeVine

### Overall Concept and motivation for development

The GrapeVine is an app that lets users build a list of their favorite wines and search a general dataset of wines for more information. 

The motivation for development was to create one place to get information about specific wines and also save information about personal wine favorites. 

Users can: 

1. Search for information about a wine (description, country of origin, points rating, price, varietal, and winery).
2. Create a user profile.
3. Add favorite wines to their profile.


### Design Process 

* After initial brainstorming, we narrowed down our ideas and landed on the wine app. Our reasoning was based on research of available data, ease of implementation, and usability.
* We also outlined an overall project plan and documented it in Google Docs. It included our MVP, User Stories, tasks, and a general schedule timeline.
* On the front end, we wireframed layouts for our different user views. 
* We decided to try a new CSS framework based on available component libraries and documentation.
* We created shell HTML, Javascript, and CSS files to hook into the back end, then configured each component by priority.
